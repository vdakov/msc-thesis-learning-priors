- Plan for Project Proposal - Deadline - 27.11
	- Proposal plan: two pages 
	- Weekly plan for meetings - Every Thursday in the Beginning, Biweekly after
	- Literature and Experiment Proposal 
		- Maybe if learn a prior, how will it be tested/verified
	- Possible new direction for project
	- First Stage: Have commitee in mind, so we can reach out  
	- Thesis Commitee Form - Three months before defence 
	- Final Examination Form - 30 days before defence
	- Presentation 27th November
	- Marunka Email
	- Every Thursday Beers 
	- Complain about rubric 
	- Define Research Question (novel, new, ) - part of project plan 
	- For project plan, hypothesis, experiments area already expected 
	- Subsquestions answered by experiments 
	- Agenda for meetings 
	- Possibly slides, meetings, inform Tom to prepare for meeting 
	- Keep meetings mostly to questions 
	- Ideally, 5-10 slides 
	- Feedback for Tom, also share 
	- After proposal, discuss schedule more 
	- Put Powerpoints and Notes  in teams 
	- Look into hackmd, 
	- Use channel header for links to GitLab, Teams, HackMD
